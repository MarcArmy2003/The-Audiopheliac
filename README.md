### 🔑 Distinction: Audiophile vs. Audiopheliac

| **Feature**        | **Audiophile**                                                                 | **Audiopheliac**                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Motivation**      | Love and appreciation for high-quality audio.                                   | Compulsion to tweak, test, and upgrade, often obsessively.                        |
| **Focus**           | Uses gear to better enjoy the music.                                           | Uses music to justify the gear; the *system* becomes the art.                     |
| **Satisfaction**    | Finds joy in balanced upgrades and great playback.                             | Rarely satisfied; always chasing the next improvement.                            |
| **Relationship**    | Music is the end goal.                                                         | The gear is the end goal.                                                         |

It’s both a name and an ethos: *sound not only loved, but obsessively pursued*.

## 📀 About This Project

This repo is my hub for all things **hi-fi and home AV**:  
- Vinyl collection logs (pressings, condition, sound notes, upgrade paths)  
- Stereo & AV gear inventories  
- Home network and automation experiments  
- Wishlist tracking for albums and equipment  

It’s equal parts listening diary, technical notebook, and sandbox for future projects.

## 🌟 Why This Exists

Because music isn’t just background noise.  
It’s a ritual. A pursuit. A collection of moments that sound better when you capture them, track them, and keep improving the chain between needle and ear.

## 🚀 Future Directions

- Automating cataloging (Discogs API, barcode/label scanning)  
- AV and home automation scripting  
- Publishing curated listening lists and setup guides
