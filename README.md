# 🎶 The Audiopheliac
**The Audiopheliac** (n.): A portmanteau of *audiophile* + *heliac*, describing one who is devoted to the pursuit of high-fidelity sound and the ritual of vinyl, new and vintage stereo gear, and home AV experimentation. Personal Hi-Fi, AV, and Vinyl Inventory Project.

## 📀 About This Project

This repo is my hub for all things **hi-fi and home AV**:  
- Vinyl collection logs (pressings, condition, sound notes, upgrade paths)  
- Stereo & AV gear inventories  
- Home network and automation experiments  
- Wishlist tracking for albums and equipment  

It’s equal parts listening diary, technical notebook, and sandbox for future projects.

## 🌟 Why This Exists

Because music isn’t just background noise.  
It’s a ritual. A pursuit. A collection of moments that sound better when you capture them, track them, and keep improving the chain between needle and ear.
