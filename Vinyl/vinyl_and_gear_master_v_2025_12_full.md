## 🔎 Strategic Collection Guidance

## Five Rule Strategy
1. No “Greatest Hits”	Focus on single-artist, studio-defined albums.
2. Pre-1995 or post-2010 only. Avoid 1995–2010 “digital purgatory.”
3. Used preferred -	Prioritize Capricorn, Columbia, Warner, and Asylum pressings.
4. Modern vinyl intent - Focus on modern artists who master for vinyl (Taylor, Post, Stapleton, Silk Sonic, etc.).
5. Compilation/Greatest Hits Exceptions:	
   - Emotional value -for example, "Sublime," Marshall Mathers LP 2, etc.
   - Critically acclaimed film soundtracks or collaborations
   - Artists I'm unlikely to purchase individual albums from

Excellent — I’ve identified the mystery record from your photos.

The album is a **Korean LP from the late 1970s** released by **Seorabeol Record Co. (서라벌레코드사 / SRB)**, catalog **IV-8150**.
It features **Park Il-Joon (박일준)** and **Kim Sang-Bum (김상범)** performing the tracks **“Unchained Melody (언체인 멜로디)”** and **“Solen Jara (솔엔자라)”**, a Korean pop ballad styled after trot/soul hybrids of that era.
