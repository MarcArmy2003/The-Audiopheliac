## 🧾 VINYL WISHLIST RULES (v2026.01)

**Purpose:**  
To maintain a curated, high-quality wishlist that reflects actual listening intent — not completionism.  
Every entry must justify its place based on sonic, emotional, or historical value to the existing collection.

### 🎚️ GUIDING PRINCIPLES

1. **No Compilations** — Unless they meet the *“Artists I’m unlikely to purchase individually”* exception.  
2. **Condition First** — Prioritize sealed or NM vinyl; VG+ only if rare or historically relevant.  
3. **Pressing Matters** — Prefer original analog or reputable remaster (MoFi, Rhino, Analogue Productions).  
4. **No Steely Dan Rule** — *Aja* and similar “engineering showcase” albums are excluded unless found cheap and clean.  
5. **Complements, Not Clutter** — Add only records that balance genres or fill historical gaps (e.g., more country, live classics).  
6. **Sonic Relevance** — Every record should *bump* or *breathe* on your actual playback chain (Scarlett → SYS → JBL/HS7 path).  
7. **Duplicate Avoidance** — Don’t buy aesthetic variants or color reissues unless they differ in mastering.  
8. **Digital Exceptions** — Certain post-CD-era albums may appear if worth FLAC archival (e.g., *The Downward Spiral*).  
9. **Emotional Rule** — If it doesn’t make you feel something, it doesn’t belong here.
