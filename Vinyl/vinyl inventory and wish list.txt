Led Zeppelin – Houses of the Holy

Label / Catalog No.: Atlantic, SD-7255, Stereo

Year: 1973 (original release year)

Condition: VG (Very Good = some scratches/groove wear, audible pops or clicks possible, but no skips)

Source / Price: Sound Exchange, purchased Monday

Notes: Favorite Zeppelin album. Sounds great on the AT-LP120XUSB. This copy is a solid spin version.

Upgrade Path: Look for an earlier pressing with “RL” (Robert Ludwig) mastering or UK A1/B1 matrices for top-tier sound.
