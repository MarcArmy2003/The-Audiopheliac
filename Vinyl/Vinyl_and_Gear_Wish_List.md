# 🔎 Strategic Collection Guidance

# Align it with the five rules:

## Rule	Applied Strategy
1. No “Greatest Hits”	Focus on single-artist, studio-defined albums.
2. Pre-1995 or post-2010 only. Avoid 1995–2010 “digital purgatory.”
3. Used preferred -	Prioritize Capricorn, Columbia, Warner, and Asylum pressings.
4. Modern vinyl intent - Focus on modern artists who master for vinyl (Taylor, Post, Stapleton, Silk Sonic, etc.).
5. Emotional value exceptions	- for example, “Sublime," Marshall Mathers LP 2, etc.

# 🧠 Conditional / Opportunistic Buys (Value-Dependent)
**Streaming satisfaction adequate; only buy if special edition or dirt cheap.**
1. Neil Young – Harvest	Only if near-mint and priced right. You respect it; don’t need it.
2. Radiohead – OK Computer	Only for a top-tier pressing under fair market; not an emotional target.
3. Steely Dan – Aja	Only if clean and fairly priced. A technical showcase, not your go-to vibe.
4. Outkast – Aquemini	Test listen before adding; potential modern analog keeper.
5. Run the Jewels – RTJ4	Optional modern analog pick if you want something aggressive and crisp.
6. Sturgill Simpson – Metamodern Sounds in Country Music (2014)
7. Tyler Childers – Purgatory
8. Willie Nelson – Red Headed Stranger
9. Alison Krauss + Union Station – So Long So Wrong (1997)
10. B.B. King – Live at the Regal
11. Buddy Guy – Damn Right, I’ve Got the Blues


# Gear Wish List:
1. Replacement upgrade to LP120 stock cartridge (perhaps Ortofon 2M Bronze).
2.  ~~Herbie's Audio Lab - Way Excellent II Turntable Mat~~
3. iFi iPower X (12V) — linear power supply upgrade for the Schiit Mani II.
4. AudioQuest Carbon USB (for Scarlett Solo to PC chain).
5. Ground loop isolator or star-ground configuration for your rack (reduce hum risk).
6. Acoustic panels or bass traps behind HS7s in your office — critical for nearfield accuracy though current set up sounds good to my ears, with curtains and couch offering some dampening.
7. Uptone Audio USB Regen (optional but subtle digital improvement for interface chain).
8. Vinyl cleaning system (Kirmuss or Spin-Clean Pro). Currently using Groove Washer G2 with horse hair brush.
9. Yamaha MusicCast supported wired/wireless speaker for secondary zones (lanai/poo, garage-gym) — optional family room pairing.
10. NAS-to-Hi-Res Streaming Integration (enable DLNA or Roon bridge on your QNAP).
